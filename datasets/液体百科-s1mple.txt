Oleksandr "s1mple" Kostyliev (born October 2, 1997) is a Ukrainian professional Counter-Strike 2 player and a former professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player. Widely considered as the greatest and most accomplished CS:GO player of all time, he has won 21 HLTV MVP medals, a Major and an Intel Grand Slam trophy, among other numerous S-Tier trophies, and has been crowned as the best player of 2018, 2021, and 2022, and the runner-up for the best player of 2019 and 2020.
In late 2023, s1mple announced he would be taking a break from competition, benching himself on Natus Vincere, where he had played since 2017; citing personal reasons and a dislike towards the state of Counter-Strike 2 at the time. Around one year later, s1mple would have a short loan stint with Team Falcons and later FaZe Clan, before completing a shock transfer to BC.Game in mid 2025.
